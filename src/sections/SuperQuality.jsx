          The moment you set foot into the doors of Divine Pizza Restaurant, you
          immediately feel like youâ€™ve walked into Italy! The melodious Italian
          tarantella music, Italian waiters shouting across the room, patrons
          tapping their feet to the music, checkered table cloth, terracotta
          walls, aroma of garlic, Italian knick knacks on the walls are all part
          of the charm in this cosy home-style restaurant.
        </p>

          We believe that our success is measured by our diner's satisfaction.
          Our day starts with you in mind.
